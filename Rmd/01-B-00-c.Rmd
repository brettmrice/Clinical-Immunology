# Biologic & Physical Properties {-}

Let's pull out the "spec sheets" for each immunoglobulin. Just like different models of cars have different performance stats, each class of antibody has a unique set of physical and biological properties. These properties are not just academic trivia; they are the very reason we can use them as diagnostic tools in the clinical laboratory

Understanding *why* IgM shows up first or *why* only IgG can cross the placenta is all about their physical and biological characteristics

## **Immunoglobulin Properties: A Comparative Spec Sheet** {-}

Let's break down the five isotypes, focusing on the properties that dictate their function and their relevance on the lab bench

### **IgG: The Memory and Might** {-}

This is our long-term, high-performance antibody. Itâ€™s built for endurance and versatility

*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Monomer (Valency of 2)
    *   **Size:** The smallest of the immunoglobulins, with a molecular weight of ~150,000 daltons. Its small size is a key feature
    *   **Serum Concentration:** The most abundant Ig in the blood, making up about **80%** of the total immunoglobulin pool

*   **Biological Properties**
    *   **Half-Life:** Has the longest half-life of all Igs, around **23 days**. This persistence is what provides long-term immunity
    *   **Placental Transfer:** Due to its small size and a specific Fc receptor on placental cells, IgG is the **only** immunoglobulin that can cross the placenta. This provides crucial passive immunity to the fetus
    *   **Complement Fixation:** Very effective at activating the classical complement pathway (especially subclasses IgG1 and IgG3), leading to lysis of pathogens
    *   **Opsonization:** It is an excellent opsonin. Phagocytic cells have Fc receptors that bind to the IgG Fc region, greatly enhancing phagocytosis

*   **Lab Takeaway:** Its long half-life and high concentration make it the perfect marker for **past infection or proof of immunity** from vaccination. Its ability to cross the placenta is the entire basis for Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN) workups

### **IgM: The First Responder** {-}

This is the "heavy artillery" of the initial response. What it lacks in finesse, it makes up for in brute force and efficiency

*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Pentamer (Valency of 10). It's a massive molecule composed of five monomer units joined by a J-chain
    *   **Size:** The largest immunoglobulin by far, with a molecular weight of ~900,000 daltons. Its huge size keeps it confined to the bloodstream
    *   **Serum Concentration:** Makes up about **5-10%** of the total immunoglobulin pool

*   **Biological Properties**
    *   **Half-Life:** Very short, only about **5 days**. It appears quickly and fades quickly once the infection is controlled
    *   **Placental Transfer:** **Cannot** cross the placenta due to its massive size. The presence of specific IgM in a newborn is therefore diagnostic of a congenital infection
    *   **Complement Fixation:** The **most efficient** activator of the classical complement pathway. The pentameric structure allows it to bind to a pathogen and easily "staple" the first complement protein (C1q) to initiate the cascade
    *   **Agglutination:** With 10 antigen-binding sites, it is the most effective agglutinating antibody, making it excellent at clumping bacteria or red blood cells

*   **Lab Takeaway:** Its short half-life and status as the first antibody produced make it the quintessential marker for a **current or acute infection**. Its agglutination power is utilized in many lab tests, including ABO reverse typing in the blood bank

### **IgA: The Mucosal Guardian** {-}

This is the specialized frontline defender, protecting the body's most vulnerable entry points

*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Monomer in the serum, but a **Dimer** (Valency of 4) in secretions, linked by a J-chain and protected by a **secretory component**
    *   **Size:** As a monomer, it's ~160,000 daltons. The secretory dimer is much larger
    *   **Serum Concentration:** About **10-15%** of serum immunoglobulins. However, it is the most abundant Ig in the entire body when all mucosal secretions are included

*   **Biological Properties**
    *   **Location:** The primary immunoglobulin in external secretions like saliva, tears, mucus, sweat, and breast milk
    *   **Function:** Functions as a neutralizing antibody, preventing viruses and bacteria from binding to and entering host cells at mucosal surfaces
    *   **Placental Transfer:** Does **not** cross the placenta, but it is transferred to newborns through colostrum and breast milk, providing critical passive immunity for the gastrointestinal tract
    *   **Complement Fixation:** Does not activate the classical complement pathway

*   **Lab Takeaway:** IgA deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency. We also consider IgA when performing transfusion workups, as IgA-deficient individuals can have a severe anaphylactic reaction to blood products containing IgA

### **IgE: The Allergy Alarm System** {-}

This antibody is present in tiny amounts but can trigger a massive, body-wide response

*   **Physical Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Monomer (Valency of 2)
    *   **Size:** ~190,000 daltons
    *   **Serum Concentration:** The **lowest** concentration of all Igs in serum

*   **Biological Properties**
    *   **Cell Binding:** Has a unique Fc region that binds with extremely high affinity to Fc receptors on **mast cells and basophils**
    *   **Function:** When an allergen binds to the Fab portions of IgE already coating a mast cell, it causes the cell to degranulate, releasing histamine and other mediators. This is the mechanism of Type I hypersensitivity (allergies and anaphylaxis). It is also involved in defense against parasitic worms
    *   **Half-Life:** Extremely short in serum (~2 days), but can last for weeks once bound to a mast cell
    *   **Placental Transfer:** Does **not** cross the placenta

*   **Lab Takeaway:** We measure total IgE and, more importantly, allergen-specific IgE levels to help diagnose allergies in patients

### **IgD: The B-Cell's Antenna** {-}

The properties of IgD are mostly related to its role on the cell surface rather than in the serum

*   **Physical & Biological Properties**
    *   **Structure:** Monomer (Valency of 2)
    *   **Serum Concentration:** Present in very low concentrations in serum
    *   **Function:** Its primary, well-understood role is as a surface receptor on naive B-lymphocytes, where it helps signal for B-cell activation. It is not known to fix complement or cross the placenta
*   **Lab Takeaway:** Has very little diagnostic utility in the routine clinical immunology lab
