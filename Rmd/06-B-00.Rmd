# Confirmatory Testing {-}

Think of diagnostic testing as a two-stage investigation process. The first stage, the **screening test**, is like sending out a wide-ranging police bulletin. It's designed to be sensitive and catch any possible suspect, even if it means pulling in a few innocent people who just happen to fit a broad description. A **confirmatory test**, on the other hand, is the intense, follow-up interrogation under the bright lights. Its job is to separate the truly guilty from the innocent and secure the definitive evidence

The bottom line is this: a screening test *suggests* a diagnosis, but a confirmatory test *proves* it. The entire philosophy of this two-tiered approach is built upon a strategic use of tests with different performance characteristics to achieve the highest possible accuracy while remaining efficient

## **The "Why": Sensitivity vs. Specificity** {-}

To understand confirmatory testing, you must be an expert on two fundamental concepts: sensitivity and specificity

*   **Sensitivity:** This is the defining characteristic of a good **screening test**. Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals who **have** the disease. A highly sensitive test "casts a wide net" and has a very low rate of false negatives
    *   **The Power of a Negative:** If a highly sensitive screening test is negative, you can be very confident that the patient does not have the disease. (Example: a negative ANA test is excellent for ruling out SLE)
    *   **The Weakness:** The trade-off for this sensitivity is often lower specificity, meaning it can produce false positives

*   **Specificity:** This is the defining characteristic of a good **confirmatory test**. Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals who **do not** have the disease. A highly specific test acts like a "sniper rifle," honing in on the one true target with very few false positives
    *   **The Power of a Positive:** If a highly specific confirmatory test is positive, you can be very confident that the patient *does* have the disease. (Example: a positive Anti-Sm antibody test is virtually diagnostic for SLE)

The two-tiered strategy is beautiful in its logic: Screen with a sensitive net, then confirm with a specific rifle

## **Characteristics of a Good Confirmatory Test** {-}

*   **High Specificity:** This is non-negotiable. Its primary job is to eliminate the false positives generated by the screening test
*   **Different Principle or Methodology:** Ideally, a confirmatory test should use a different technology or target a different analyte than the screening test. This helps ensure that if there was some weird interfering substance causing a false positive on the screen, it won't affect the confirmation
*   **High Positive Predictive Value (PPV):** This means that when the test is positive, the probability that the patient actually has the disease is very high

## **Classic Examples** {-}

This is where the theory meets the real world. Let's look at the classic algorithms that every MLS must know

### **Syphilis (The Absolute Classic)** {-}
*   **Screening Test:** The **RPR** (a nontreponemal test)
    *   **What it does:** Detects reagin antibodies, a sensitive but non-specific marker of cellular damage
    *   **The Problem:** Can be falsely positive due to other conditions (lupus, pregnancy, other infections)
*   **Confirmatory Test:** The **TP-PA** or a treponemal EIA/CLIA (a treponemal test)
    *   **What it does:** Detects antibodies made *specifically* against *Treponema pallidum* antigens
    *   **The Interpretation:** If the RPR is reactive and the TP-PA is reactive, you have a confirmed case of syphilis. If the RPR is reactive but the TP-PA is nonreactive, you have a **biological false positive**, and the patient does not have syphilis. This is the perfect demonstration of a confirmatory test's job

### **Lyme Disease (CDC-Mandated Algorithm)** {-}
*   **Screening Test (Tier 1):** An **Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA)**
    *   **What it does:** Detects total antibodies to a crude lysate of *Borrelia burgdorferi*
    *   **The Problem:** It's very sensitive but can cross-react with antibodies from other infections (like EBV or other spirochetes), leading to false positives
*   **Confirmatory Test (Tier 2):** The **Western Blot**
    *   **What it does:** This test is only performed if the EIA is positive. It separates the bacterial proteins by size and looks for antibodies against a specific pattern of key *Borrelia* proteins. A positive result requires reactivity to a certain number of specific bands (e.g., 5 of 10 for IgG). This high level of pattern specificity proves the antibodies are the real deal

### **HIV Infection** {-}
*   **Screening Test:** The **4th Generation Combination Immunoassay**
    *   **What it does:** A highly sensitive test that simultaneously detects both HIV antibodies and the p24 antigen, shortening the window period
*   **Confirmatory Test:** The **HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody Differentiation Immunoassay**
    *   **What it does:** If the screen is positive, this rapid test confirms the presence of antibodies and, critically, tells you *which* type of HIV the patient has (HIV-1 or HIV-2), which is important for guiding therapy
    *   **Note:** The Western Blot, while historically the classic confirmatory test for HIV, has been replaced by this more efficient and informative algorithm

## **A Modern Twist: The Reverse Algorithm** {-}

The advancement of technology has flipped some of our classic algorithms on their head. In high-volume labs, it's now common to use a highly sensitive and automatable **treponemal EIA/CLIA** as the initial **screen** for syphilis

*   **The Process:** Screen with the specific (but very sensitive) treponemal test. If it's reactive, then you perform the nontreponemal **RPR**
*   **The "Confirmation":** In this case, the RPR's role shifts slightly. It's not confirming the diagnosis (the treponemal test already did that), but rather it's confirming the **activity** of the disease. A reactive RPR suggests an active or recently treated infection, while a nonreactive RPR in the face of a reactive treponemal test suggests an old, successfully treated infection

The bottom line is that the laboratory is not just running isolated tests. We are executing a deliberate, logical diagnostic strategy designed to provide the most accurate and clinically relevant information possible. Understanding the role of each test in that strategy is the mark of a true Medical Laboratory Scientist
